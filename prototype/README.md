###Simple viewing
Go the `/app` and drag and drop the `.html` files into your browser of choice to view.

###Making changes and live reload
To get up and running, run `npm install` in your CLI in the project directory. Then run `grunt`. Your browser should automatically open localhost:300X. That's it. You are good to go.
